Plaid Financial Analytics â€“ A Data-Driven Dashboard to generate insights

Client Background Client A leading financial firm in the USA Industry Type Finance Services Financial Services Organization Size 100 The Problem Applying automation to Financial data coming from the Plaid platform that needs to be visualized in order to get better insights and metrics from data. Our Solution The intention was to create an automation tool that could consume the financial csv format data and perform preprocessing on that data and could directly present the insights on visually appealing dashboard. Initially the step was to create a toolwebsite that could consume the data and preprocess it and send it either directly to dashboard or into a database so the data could be safe and through the database the dashboard could be linked and updates accordingly. The data source for the tool was to be a manual entry therefore we created a website and hosted it on a cloud platform(Heroku) to make it available all the time for all the desired users. The processed data from this tool will be send to the Google big query database and our GBQ will be linked to the Google Data Studio for the insights presentation. Therefore as the data will keep on updating in the google big query accordingly the dashboard in our google data studio will gets updated. Solution Architecture Deliverables The final deliverable was the ready-to-use dashboard and website where the preprocessing of the data happens.
